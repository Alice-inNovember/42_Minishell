Rule 1. [Command Name]

	When the TOKEN is exactly a reserved word, the token identifier for that reserved word shall result. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.
	Also, if the parser is in any state where only a reserved word could be the next correct token, proceed as above.

	Note:
	Because at this point <quotation-mark> characters are retained in the token, quoted strings cannot be recognized as reserved words. 
	This rule also implies that reserved words are not recognized except in certain positions in the input, 
	such as after a <newline> or <semicolon>; the grammar presumes that if the reserved word is intended, 
	it is properly delimited by the user, and does not attempt to reflect that requirement directly. 
	Also note that line joining is done before tokenization, as described in Escape Character (Backslash), 
	so escaped <newline> characters are already removed at this point.

Rule 2. [Redirection to or from filename]

	The expansions specified in Redirection shall occur. As specified there, exactly one field can result (or the result is unspecified), 
	and there are additional requirements on pathname expansion. 


Rule 3. [Redirection from here-document]

	Quote removal shall be applied to the word to determine the delimiter that is used to find the end of the here-document that begins 
	after the next <newline>.


Rule 7. [Assignment preceding command name]

	a. [When the first word]

		If the TOKEN does not contain the character '=', rule 1 is applied. Otherwise, 7b shall be applied.

	b. [Not the first word]

		If the TOKEN contains an unquoted (as determined while applying rule 4 from Token Recognition) <equals-sign> character 
		that is not part of an embedded parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion construct 
		(as determined while applying rule 5 from Token Recognition):

		If the TOKEN begins with '=', then rule 1 shall be applied.

		If all the characters in the TOKEN preceding the first such <equals-sign> form a valid name (see XBD Name), 
		the token ASSIGNMENT_WORD shall be returned.

		Otherwise, it is unspecified whether rule 1 is applied or ASSIGNMENT_WORD is returned.

		Otherwise, rule 1 shall be applied.

		Assignment to the name within a returned ASSIGNMENT_WORD token shall occur as specified in Simple Commands.
