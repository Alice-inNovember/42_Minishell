Rule 2. [Redirection to or from filename]

The expansions specified in Redirection shall occur. As specified there, exactly one field can result (or the result is unspecified), and there are additional requirements on pathname expansion. 


Rule 3. [Redirection from here-document]

Quote removal shall be applied to the word to determine the delimiter that is used to find the end of the here-document that begins after the next <newline>.


Rule 7. [Assignment preceding command name]

	a. [When the first word]

		If the TOKEN does not contain the character '=', rule 1 is applied. Otherwise, 7b shall be applied.

	b. [Not the first word]

		If the TOKEN contains an unquoted (as determined while applying rule 4 from Token Recognition) <equals-sign> character 
		that is not part of an embedded parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion construct 
		(as determined while applying rule 5 from Token Recognition):

		If the TOKEN begins with '=', then rule 1 shall be applied.

		If all the characters in the TOKEN preceding the first such <equals-sign> form a valid name (see XBD Name), 
		the token ASSIGNMENT_WORD shall be returned.

		Otherwise, it is unspecified whether rule 1 is applied or ASSIGNMENT_WORD is returned.

		Otherwise, rule 1 shall be applied.

		Assignment to the name within a returned ASSIGNMENT_WORD token shall occur as specified in Simple Commands.
